/*
    The sportstore app will use async http requests to get model data
    provided by a RESTful web service.

    REST is an approach to building web services that uses the http method
    or verb to specifiy an operation and a URL to select the data objects
    that the operations apply to.

    The json-webserver package is a tool for quickly generating web services from JSON
    data.

    This ensures a fixed state that the project can be reset to.
